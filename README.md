## Setup Guide

1. Install dependencies in client and server folders
2. Add .env file in server directory, set PORT=3001, set NEWS_API_KEY={api key from "Currents API" https://currentsapi.services/en}. No API key is required for the Reddit API.
3. Front end is already linked to backend so just run npm start in server folder

Note -  At the moment the sentiment analysis page isnt going to work just yet but the home page still runs
